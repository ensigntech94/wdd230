          Explore the official website of The Church of Jesus Christ of
          Latter-day Saints. The principle of proximity is demonstrated in how
          related elements are grouped together. For example, on the homepage,
          announcements, upcoming events, and featured messages may be placed in
          close proximity, creating a visual association between them. This
          design choice helps users quickly identify and access relevant
          information without unnecessary visual clutter.
